For Deployments: Used A ReplicationController 
- It ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a ReplicationController makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.
- If there are too many pods, the ReplicationController terminates the extra pods. If there are too few, the ReplicationController starts more pods.
